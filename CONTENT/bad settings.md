# Avoiding Bad Settings

- Questionable Tweaks and Settings: Avoid settings and tweaks listed on Tweakhound as potentially harmful or ineffective. This includes changes to the registry or system settings that can cause system instability without noticeable performance improvements. Before applying any changes, make sure they are based on reliable sources and validated by the community. Bad tweaks can do more harm than help.

- For those who are new to this area, I can reveal one important secret. A lot of useful information that we used to share for free is now inaccessible. And this is not only our share of responsibility. Many reputable experts stopped sharing their knowledge openly, because some scammers started to use this information and sell it to people who do not have proper understanding. 

- When these scammers customize your system, they follow a simple principle: "This helped me". Often they don't even understand half of what they are doing, and when asked "Why are you doing it this way?" they answer: "It worked for me, so I'm doing it the same way for you."

- It's important to realize that it's not the system setup that makes you a better player, it's you yourself. Your motivation, purpose, and drive to succeed make you a potentially stronger player, not your operating system optimization. Try maintaining a stable sleep pattern for 30 days and you'll get more benefits than from any OS tweaks.
