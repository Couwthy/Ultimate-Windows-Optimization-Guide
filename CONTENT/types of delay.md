# Types of delay

## Preface
- Here are the main types of delay and their descriptions and how they manifest themselves

## List:

- Slapback delay is a short, single, non-feedback delay that adds an echo effect with a delay of up to 120ms. It is often used to create a more three-dimensional and spatial sound, without overloading too many echoes.

- Multi tap delay is an effect where the sound is split into multiple delayed signals that are played one after the other. This allows you to create complex textures and rhythmic patterns.

- Stereo delay - an effect where the left and right channels are processed with different feedback and delay time parameters. This creates a more spatial sound and a wide stereo effect.

- Rhythmic delay is an effect similar to stereo delay, but here the channel delay time parameters are set so that the repetition sound matches the rhythm of the music.

- Ping pong delay is a delayed sound that is panned alternately between the left and right channels. This creates the effect of the sound moving from side to side and adds spatiality to the sound.

- Reverse is an effect that plays back the sound recorded in the buffer in reverse order, creating amazing and unusual sound effects.

- Dynamic delay is an effect where the level of the delayed signal depends on the level of the input signal. This allows the delayed phrases to sound more organic and not drown out the original signal.

- Modulated delay is an effect where the delayed signal is processed with other effects, such as chorus or flanger, giving the sound a richer and more interesting sound.
