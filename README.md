## Preface
- This guide is aimed at optimizing the latest Windows 10/11 systems. I have been collecting information on system customization for several months, because for many people even the most obvious information is hidden and do not forget that many people still believe in placebo advice. After reading this guide you will be able to customize the system for your needs.

## Requirements
- Windows 10 or 11 latest build is installed, being able to read carefully means that the operating system is running its most updated version, capable of providing a more stable and secure computer, as well as support for new features and enhancements. It also implies that this system is running on build 2004, which is an interim update version containing bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features originally released for Windows 10. Reading and understanding information about the installed version of the operating system is important to ensure that your computer is operating correctly and to account for the need for additional updates or maintenance.
