# Ultimate-Windows-Optimization-Guide

## Preface
- This guide is aimed at optimizing the latest Windows 10/11 systems. I have been collecting information on system customization for several months, because for many people even the most obvious information is hidden and do not forget that many people still believe in placebo advice. After reading this guide you will be able to customize the system for your needs.

## Requirements
- Windows 10 or 11 latest build installed, ability to read carefully
